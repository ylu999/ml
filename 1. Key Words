Classification: when value are discrete. Ex: face recogenation, action recogenation
Regression: when value are non-discrete, Ex: house price prediction, stock price prediction
Binary classification: only two class to determine. Ex: true/false, is animal or not, stock price up/down, Positive/Negative
Multi-class classification: multiple class to determine.
Clustering: Gather similar data to one group
Multi-labeling annotation: Compare to Classification, this handles more complex scenario with multiple class to identify Ex: photo search
