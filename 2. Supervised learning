Learn a mapping from input to output, called model
The collection of model is hypothesis space.

Model:
  Probability model: Conditional probability distribution P(Y|X)
  Non-Probability model: Determination function Y=f(X)
Union probability distribution: Assume the random variable from input(X) and output(Y) follows union probability distributionP(X,Y)
